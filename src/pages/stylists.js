            Hilary has been living her dream of making Seattlites look and feel
            their best since 2010. Straight or curly, fine or coarse, short or
            long - she loves to do it all. Other than making her clients look
            and feel their best, her goal is to create ease, style and longevity
            in every cut and color (and extensions!) that she does and to
            educate her clients on how to make the most of their hair at home,
            whether you’re the wash-and-go type or you like put some effort in
            to styling. She’s always excited to meet new people and to play with
            new hair!
